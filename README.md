## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Mood Analysis
- Navigate to the "🎭 Mood Analysis" section
- Describe your mood, feelings, or desired atmosphere
- Click "🔍 Analyze Mood" to get detailed analysis with visualizations

### 2. Music Parameters
- Go to "🎶 Music Parameters" section
- Select a mood category or use analyzed mood
- Adjust energy level and complexity in the sidebar
- Generate parameters and preview audio

### 3. Analytics
- Visit "📊 Analytics" to see usage trends
- View popular moods and tempo distributions

## 🎼 Music Theory Integration

The application uses established music theory principles:
- **Scales**: Major, minor, modal scales based on mood
- **Chord Progressions**: Common progressions (I-V-vi-IV, ii-V-I, etc.)
- **Tempo Mapping**: BPM ranges appropriate for different moods
- **Key Selection**: Major/minor tonality based on sentiment
- **Dynamics**: Volume levels mapped to energy
- **Texture**: Monophonic to polyphonic based on complexity

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Settings (config.py)
```python
SENTIMENT_MODEL = "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
MAX_LENGTH = 128
DEVICE = "cpu"  # Change to "cuda" if GPU available
```

### Audio Settings
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz
- Audio Format: WAV
- Duration: 8 seconds (configurable)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model loading errors**: Ensure internet connection for first-time model downloads
2. **Audio playback issues**: Check browser audio permissions
3. **Slow performance**: Consider using GPU by changing DEVICE to "cuda" in config.py
